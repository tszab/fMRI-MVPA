Homework assignment for an intelligen data analysis course. The objective of this work was to get familiar with fMRI data and the pre-processing steps commonly applied to them, as well as multivoxel pattern analysis with SVMs. For more information, please, feel free to read the report.

All notebooks are included in this repository, and the data sets used in this study are publicly available. Parts of the experiments were run on Kaggle. Those links will be included in the future.
